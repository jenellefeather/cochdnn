15) Linear classifier for HMAX model trained on imagenet task. Final accuracy is not great (around 6%). Model implementation derived from here: https://github.com/wmvanvliet/pytorch_hmax and uses universal_patch_set.mat which is the same as that from https://maxlab.neuro.georgetown.edu/hmax.html. Training augmentations for the linear classifier included converting the image to greyscale, as HMAX operates on greyscale images. Model was trained for 30 EPOCHs at a batch size of 256 using eight Tesla-V100 GPUs (DGX machine). Learning rate started at 0.1 and was dropped by a factor of 10 after every 10 epochs. This model also had gradient clippingapplied, clipping the gradients to a maxnorm of 1.0, and a "warmup" learning rate for the first X gradient steps.

Network defined using the vonenet repository (https://github.com/dicarlolab/vonenet) with additional modifications following (https://github.com/chung-neuroai-lab/adversarial-manifolds) for gaussian noise rather than poisson noise (which is easier to tune for robustness). Trained by jfeather on openmind cluster using 8 tesla-v100 GPUs (DGX machine) with a total batch size of 256. Learning rate started at 0.01 and was dropped by a factor of 10 after every 50 epochs.
