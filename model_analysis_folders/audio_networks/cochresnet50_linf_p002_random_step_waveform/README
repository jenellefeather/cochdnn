An architecture based on ResNet50 but trained on cochleagrams. Adversarial examples are generating during the training process constrained with an Linf norm on the waveform = 0.002. 

The input to the network is a cochleagram representation rather than an image (rectangular rather than square). Square filters are still used throughout the network.
